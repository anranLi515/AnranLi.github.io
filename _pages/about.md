**Research Fellow**.  
School of Computer Science and Engineering.  
Nanyang Technological University, Singapore

I received my Ph.D degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. Xiang-yang Li and Prof. Lan Zhang. 
I received my Bachelor degree from Anhui University of Science and Technology, China. 

My current research interests are task-oriented data quality assessment for large-scale datasets, federated learning and mobile computing.
