I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Biomedical Informatics & Data Science, School of Medicine at Yale University with Prof. [Qingyu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/qingyuchen/home). Also, I worked closely with Prof. [Hyunghoon Cho](https://hhcho.com/) and Prof. [Hua Xu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/). Prior to joining Yale University, I was a Research Fellow at the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University with Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/), Prof. [Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/) and Prof. [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/). I received my Ph.D degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiang-Yang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/index.html) and Prof. [Lan Zhang](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0706/c23235a460088/page.htm). 

My research interests focus on trustworthy AI, medical large language models, federated learning and graph learning.
