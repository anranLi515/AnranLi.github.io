My research interests focus on trustworthy AI, medical large language models, federated learning and graph learning. I have been working on the following topics: 
* **Memorization, Privacy, and Safety of Medical LLMs**: We have investigated and quantified the memorization in large language models (LLMs) in medicine, highlighting the potential risks of memorization in medical models. We analyze the factors affecting memorization in large medical models. We conduct case study to identify sensitive information leakage by evaluating model memorizations.
